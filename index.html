						Minimalism. Thats what this <u>webpage</u> represents. Web<u>page</u>, not web<u>site</u>.
						This is not a site of  multiple pages, but a single html file using sections to divide 
						itself into "pages". This adheres to the foundational commandments of both the  <a class=link
						href=https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/small-internet.html>"Small Internet Movement"</a>,
						and the <a class=link href=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405142659/http:/

						As stated by the all holy <a class="link"
						href=https://stallman.org/saint.html><i>Saint IGNUcius</i></a>, "There is no 
						system but GNU, and Linux is one of its kernels.", the only true operating systems are those
						following the FOSS philosophy. As a continuation of this idea, all projects created and 
						maintained by me, Alex Bell, will adhere to the prinicples of FOSS. In terms of this 
						page itself, it contains only html and css, with no java script that requires your machine to
						process. 100% of the processing power is done on the hosting side, with your machine's only
						task being to request and disply this page -- thus being completely libre.
